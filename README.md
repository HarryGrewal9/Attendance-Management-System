Introduction:

Roll-Call, which is an attendance management system, is a software developed for daily attendance in colleges and institutes. It facilitates marking the attendance information of all students in a particular lecture group. This system will increase efficiency of maintaining attendance and reduce manual work of teachers once the Database of students and teachers is created.

The audience of this system will be: 
1. Students 
2. Faculty members 
3. Administration

The intention of developing this Attendance Management System is to computerize the traditional way of taking attendance. Another purpose for developing this software is to generate the desired reports automatically at the end of the session or in the between of the session as they require. This project is basically a web-app which will automate the attendance process. It also enhances the speed of the performing attendance task easily.
